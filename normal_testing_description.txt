Testing in Scheme

(NOTE: this is pretty much copied straight up from a Piazza post.
Here's a link to it, if it's still up:

From reading the scheme files loaded when you start stk, I found a testing framework.
Not sure if we'll ever talk about it, so I'll talk about it.

Actually, it should be pretty useful (but not necessary!) for project 1 (which wants some kind of testing).

Andrew's Note: this is extra stuff. If you don't feel comfortable using this and/or you don't get what's going on here, you don't have to use it.

It works like this (half of this is taken from comments in the file, example is my own.):

Add test calls
with

(add-test-case <name> <expected-result> <expression>)

<name> is a number, symbol, or string.
<expected-result> can be a value or an expression.
<expression> is the scheme call to test.

NOTE: If a test case with the same <name> has already been added, add-test-case will not add this test case in.
It will just keep the old one and do nothing (except spit out warnings).

Run the test cases
Run tests cases (that have been added) with run-test-cases. Reports names of test-cases that failed and those that caused errors.

Run ALL the test cases:

(run-test-cases)

Run all tests cases for <expression>(s) that start with a call to <function>:

(run-test-cases <function>)

Run all test cases that have a <name> that *starts* with <name-start>:

(run-test-cases <name-start>)


Clear test cases
Removes all test cases (useful if you want to add a new test over one with a conflicting name):

(clear-test-cases)


Example:

;; add tests
(add-test-case 'plus-1 3 (+ 1 2))
(add-test-case 'plus-2 99 (+ 54 45))
(add-test-case 'square 100 (square 10))
(add-test-case 'strange-test 0 (+ 0 0))

;;test all cases above
(run-test-cases)

;; test cases with names starting with 'plus 
;; (i.e. plus-1 & plus 2)
(run-test-cases 'plus)

;; test cases involving function +
;; (i.e. plus-1, plus-2, strange-test)
(run-test-cases +)

;; clear all tests
(clear-tests-cases)

;; run-test-cases returns nothing now! No test cases!
(run-test-cases)

;; ... but now we can add tests again, with no name conflicts =)
(add-test-case 'plus-1 23 (+ 11 12))
(add-test-case 'plus-2 1001 (+ 551 450))

;; run new plus-1, plus-2 tests
(run-test-cases)
